\section{Extended Problem Definition}
A system is needed to manage internship adverts posted by companies so that students can browse
through them and apply if they are interested.
In order for this system to be successful it requires a login mechanism, allowing a company
to submit and edit their adverts. Submitted adverts are then approved by the Course
Co-ordinator. If approved they will be made available for the students to see.
Applying will direct the student to the appropriate apply page belonging to the company. 
The Course Co-ordinator will remove any adverts that have been filled or whose deadlines have expired.\\

\section{Use Case Descriptions}

This section describes the required functionality for the internship management system as four groups of related
use cases. The core use cases for the system are:\\

\textbf{Submission of internship advert by Company (Section 4.1):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Submit internship advert
\item Edit advert
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Review and approval of internship adverts by Course Co-ordinator (Section 4.2):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Review internship adverts
\item Approve internship advert
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Review of adverts by Student (Section 4.3):}
\begin{itemize}
\item View internship adverts
\item Apply for internship
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Notification of successful internship placement by student (Section 4.4):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Notify if successful placement
\item Remove internship advert
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Common utility services (Section 4.5):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Login
\item Logout
\end{itemize}

\begin{UseCaseTemplate}
\UseCaseLabel{Submit internship advert}
\UseCaseDescription{A company should login and post internship adverts to the system,
confirm it and logout.}
\UseCaseRationale{During the client interview we were given the requirement that a company must be able to submit internship adverts to the system in order for the students to view and apply for the placement.}
\UseCasePriority{Must have}
\UseCaseStatus{Not implemented}
\UseCaseActors{Company}
\UseCaseIncludes{Login, Logout}
\UseCaseConditions{\textbf{Post:} The advert is stored in the system, pending approval by the CC.}
\UseCaseNonFunctionalRequirements{Security}
\UseCaseScenarios{IBM are wanting to submit an internship advert to the system. They log in to the system using their designated username IBM, fill out the submission form, confirm their submission and submit it to the system to eventually be approved by Timothy Storer, the current CC. IBM then log out of the system.}
\UseCaseRisks{}
\end{UseCaseTemplate}

\begin{UseCaseTemplate}
\UseCaseLabel{Edit internship advert}
\UseCaseDescription{A company must login, make changes to their advert where necessary,
confirm changes and then logout.}

\UseCaseRisks{During client interview we were told that this probably wouldn't be needed, yet during the stakeholder panel meeting it was made clear that it was a valid requirement.}

\UseCaseLabel{Review internship adverts}
\UseCaseDescription{CC must login, read through new/edited adverts posted
and decide if they are suitable for the students.}

\UseCaseRisks{}
\end{UseCaseTemplate}

\begin{UseCaseTemplate}
\UseCaseLabel{Apply for internship}
\UseCaseDescription{User selects an advert to apply for and will then have to email the company or will be directed to the company website to apply}

He selects the Apply option, chooses the IBM internship and confirms his selection. Jim's browser then directs him to IBM's apply page on their website.}
\UseCaseRisks{The stakeholder panel meeting somewhat contradicted what we had gathered from our client interview, saying that applying through the system itself would be outwith the system scope. However, we felt that having the browser open the company's own apply URL was a reasonable compromise.}

\subsection{Notification of successful internship placement by student}

He logs in to the system in order to notify Timothy Storer, the current Course Co-ordinator, that he has got the placement. He selects the relevant option and selects the IBM placement to notify the Course Co-ordinator.}
\UseCaseRisks{The stakeholder panel meeting left this requirement necessity somewhat abiguous but we didn't feel it was outwith the system scope.}
\end{UseCaseTemplate}

\begin{UseCaseTemplate}
\UseCaseLabel{Remove internship advert}
\UseCaseDescription{Course Coordinator logins in to system. If advert is passed deadline or no
longer suitable or available, the advert will be taken off the system and then log out.}
\UseCaseRationale{During our client interview we gathered that the CC must be able to remove adverts that were no longer available or had passed the deadline.}
\UseCasePriority{Must have}

\begin{UseCaseTemplate}
\UseCaseLabel{Logout}
\UseCaseDescription{The logout use cases changes a users account to logged out, requiring
them to have to log back in to the system. Logout is either invoked by the user or by the internal
inactivity timer actor.}
\UseCaseRationale{Logging out was ascertained to be a requirement both from client interview and stakeholder panel meeting.}

\section{Non Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item User Concurrency: The system should be available to all Students of the School of Computing Science and a large number of users might want to use the system at the same time so the System should be able to handle a large number of users at once.
\item Data Consistency: The system must maintain data accuracy and integrity throughout the sytem's use, to ensure that each user observes a consistent view of the data despite any changes made by other users.
\item Security: Students should be able to log in with their GUIDs and passowrds which would be the same used for other University of Glasgow websites such as Moodle and MyCampus. Employers who wish to use the system to post placement adverts will need to be provided with new usernames and passwords in order to use the system.
\item Number of Adverts: The system must be able to handle an unlimited number of adverts. Any number of companies might offer placement opportunities for students each year therefore the number of adverts that can be posted on the system must not be limited.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Summary}

A company should upload their adverts to the system. The course coordinator will review
all adverts posted to the system and determine whether or not they are appropriate for the
students. If appropriate, the CC makes the advert available for the students to view. If a student
wants to apply for an advert, they will email the company or apply through their website. If
a student successfully secures a placement, they must notify the course coordinator. If all
placements have been filled, the CC can take the adverts off the system.

\section{Stakeholder Interview Documentation}

Key points we got from our interview with the client are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The company does not directly interact with the system.
\item The Course Coordinator will review adverts sent via email and if they are suitable, would
then be posted on the system.
\item When applying for internships, students will be redirected to the company website or given
an email address in order to send in their CV.
\item Students will be able to flag inappropriate adverts to the CC.
\item Students will notify the CC of a successful placement via email.
\item The Company must also verify a successful placement to avoid students abusing the
system.
\item Once a student has accepted a placement, the advert is taken off the system.
\end{itemize}

\section{Stakeholder Panel Documentation}

Originally, we were informed that the company would not interact with the system, all adverts
would be submitted via email to the course coordinator. However, at the stakeholder meeting
it was clarified that the company would interact with the system. The company will be given a
username and password and will be able to post their adverts directly to the system. They will
have a to fill out a standard form with all the relevant information before submitting the advert.
The course coordinator will then review it to determine whether or not it is relevant for the
students. If so, the adverts is made available to the students.
