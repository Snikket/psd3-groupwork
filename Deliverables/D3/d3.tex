\section{Extended Problem Definition}
A system is needed to manage internship adverts posted by companies so that students can browse
through them and apply if they are interested.
In order for this system to be successful it requires a login mechanism, allowing a company
to submit and edit their adverts. Submitted adverts are then approved by the Course
Co-ordinator. If approved they will be made available for the students to see.
Applying will direct the student to the appropriate apply page belonging to the company. 
The Course Co-ordinator will remove any adverts that have been filled or whose deadlines have expired.\\

\section{Use Case Descriptions}

This section describes the required functionality for the internship management system as four groups of related
use cases. The core use cases for the system are:\\

\textbf{Submission of internship advert by Company (Section 4.1):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Submit internship advert
\item Edit advert
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Review and approval of internship adverts by Course Co-ordinator (Section 4.2):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Review internship adverts
\item Approve internship advert
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Review of adverts by Student (Section 4.3):}
\begin{itemize}
\item View internship adverts
\item Apply for internship
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Notification of successful internship placement by Student (Section 4.4):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Notify of successful placement
\item Remove internship advert
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Common utility services (Section 4.5):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Login
\item Logout
\end{itemize}

\UseCaseRationale{During the client interview we were given the requirement that a company must be able to submit internship adverts to the system in order for the students to view and apply for the placement.}
\UseCasePriority{Must have}
\UseCaseStatus{Not implemented}
\UseCaseActors{Company}
\UseCaseIncludes{Login, Logout}
\UseCaseConditions{\textbf{Post:} The advert is stored in the system, pending approval by the CC.}
\UseCaseNonFunctionalRequirements{Security}
\UseCaseScenarios{IBM are wanting to submit an internship advert to the system. They log in to the system using their designated username, IBM, fill out the submission form, confirm their submission and submit it to the system to eventually be approved by Timothy Storer, the current CC. IBM then logs out of the system.}
\UseCaseRisks{}

\begin{UseCaseTemplate}
\UseCaseLabel{Edit internship advert}
\UseCaseDescription{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{img/EditAdvert.png}}
\UseCaseRationale{During the stakeholder panel meeting the need for companies to be able to edit pending approval adverts was clarified to be a requirement.}

\UseCaseScenarios{IBM realise that the advert they have previously submitted contains the wrong starting date. They log in to the system, select the relevant advert and section they want to edit and correct the starting date. They confirm their changes and then log out.}
\UseCaseRisks{During client interview we were told that this probably wouldn't be needed, yet during the stakeholder panel meeting it was made clear that it was a valid requirement.}

\subsection{Review and approval of internship adverts by Course Co-ordinator}

\begin{UseCaseTemplate}

\UseCaseIncludes{Login, View internship adverts, Logout}
\UseCaseConditions{\textbf{Pre:} Must have advert(s) approved by the CC.}

\UseCaseScenarios{Jim, the 3rd year Software Engineering student, wants to apply for the IBM internship that he saw whilst reviewing the available internships. He selects the Apply option, chooses the IBM internship and confirms his selection. Jim's browser then directs him to IBM's apply page on their website.}
\UseCaseRisks{The stakeholder panel meeting somewhat contradicted what we had gathered from our client interview, saying that applying through the system itself would be outwith the system scope. However, we felt that having the browser open the company's own apply URL was a reasonable compromise.}

He selects the relevant option and selects the IBM placement to notify the Course Co-ordinator.}
\UseCaseRisks{The stakeholder panel meeting left this requirement somewhat abiguous but we didn't feel it was outwith the system scope.}
\end{UseCaseTemplate}

\begin{UseCaseTemplate}
\UseCaseLabel{Remove internship advert}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Non Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item User Concurrency: The system should be available to all Students of the School of Computing Science. A large number of users might want to use the system at the same time so the system should be able to handle a large number of users at once.
\item Data Consistency: The system must maintain data accuracy and integrity throughout the sytem's use to ensure that each user observes a consistent view of the data despite any changes made by other users.
\item Security: Students and Course Co-ordinator should be able to log in with their GUIDs and passwords which would be the same used for other University of Glasgow websites such as Moodle and MyCampus. Employers who wish to use the system to post internship adverts will need to be provided with new usernames and passwords in order to use the system.
\item Number of Adverts: The system must be able to handle an unlimited number of adverts. Any number of companies might offer placement opportunities for students each year therefore the number of adverts that can be posted on the system must not be limited.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Summary}

A company should upload their adverts to the system. The course coordinator will review
all adverts posted to the system and determine whether or not they are appropriate for the
students. If appropriate, the CC makes the advert available for the students to browse. If a student
wants to apply for an advert, they will be redirected to the company's website or apply through their website. If
a student successfully secures a placement, they must notify the Course Co-ordinator. The Course Co-ordinator will then remove the advert from the system if all placements have been filled or if the advert has passed the deadline.

\section{Stakeholder Interview Documentation}

Key points we got from our interview with the client are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The company does not directly interact with the system.
\item The Course Coordinator will review adverts sent via email and if they are suitable, would
then be posted on the system.
\item When applying for internships, students will be redirected to the company website or given
an email address in order to send in their CV.
\item Students will notify the CC of a successful placement.
\item Once a student has accepted a placement, the advert is taken off the system.
\end{itemize}

\section{Stakeholder Panel Documentation}

Originally, we were informed that the company would not interact with the system, all adverts
would be submitted via email to the course coordinator. However, at the stakeholder meeting
it was clarified that the company would interact with the system. The company will be given a
username and password and will be able to post their adverts directly to the system. They will
have a to fill out a standard form with all the relevant information before submitting the advert.
The course coordinator will then review it to determine whether or not it is relevant for the
students. If so, the adverts is made available to the students.
