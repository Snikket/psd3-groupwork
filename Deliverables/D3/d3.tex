\section{Extended Problem Definition}
A system is needed to manage internship adverts posted by companies so that students can browse
through them and apply if they are interested.
In order for this system to be successful it requires a login mechanism, allowing a company
to submit and edit their adverts. Submitted adverts are then approved by the Course
Co-ordinator. If approved they will be made available for the students to see.
Applying will direct the student to the appropriate apply page belonging to the company. 
The Course Co-ordinator will remove any adverts that have been filled or whose deadlines have expired.\\

This section describes the required functionality for the internship management system as four groups of related
use cases. The core use cases for the system are:\\

\textbf{Submission of internship advert by Company (Section 4.1):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Submit internship advert
\item Edit advert
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Review and approval of internship adverts by Course Co-ordinator (Section 4.2):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Review internship adverts
\item Approve internship advert
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Review of adverts by Student (Section 4.3):}
\begin{itemize}
\item View internship adverts
\item Apply for internship
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Notification of successful internship placement by student (Section 4.4):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Notify Course Co-ordinator of successful placement
\item Remove internship advert
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Common utility services (Section 4.5):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Login
\item Logout
\end{itemize}

\section{Non Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item User Concurrency: The system should be available to all Students of the School of Computing Science and a large number of users might want to use the system at the same time so the System should be able to handle a large number of users at once.
\item Data Consistency: The system must maintain data accuracy and integrity throughout the sytem's use, to ensure that each user observes a consistent view of the data despite any changes made by other users.
\item Security: Students should be able to log in with their GUIDs and passowrds which would be the same used for other University of Glasgow websites such as Moodle and MyCampus. Employers who wish to use the system to post placement adverts will need to be provided with new usernames and passwords in order to use the system.
\item Number of Adverts: The system must be able to handle an unlimited number of adverts. Any number of companies might offer placement opportunities for students each year therefore the number of adverts that can be posted on the system must not be limited.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Summary}

A company should upload their adverts to the system. The course coordinator will review
all adverts posted to the system and determine whether or not they are appropriate for the
students. If appropriate, the CC makes the advert available for the students to view. If a student
wants to apply for an advert, they will email the company or apply through their website. If
a student successfully secures a placement, they must notify the course coordinator. If all
placements have been filled, the CC can take the adverts off the system.

\section{Stakeholder Interview Documentation}

Key points we got from our interview with the client are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The company does not directly interact with the system.
\item The Course Coordinator will review adverts sent via email and if they are suitable, would
then be posted on the system.
\item When applying for internships, students will be redirected to the company website or given
an email address in order to send in their CV.
\item Students will be able to flag inappropriate adverts to the CC.
\item Students will notify the CC of a successful placement via email.
\item The Company must also verify a successful placement to avoid students abusing the
system.
\item Once a student has accepted a placement, the advert is taken off the system.
\end{itemize}

\section{Stakeholder Panel Documentation}

Originally, we were informed that the company would not interact with the system, all adverts
would be submitted via email to the course coordinator. However, at the stakeholder meeting
it was clarified that the company would interact with the system. The company will be given a
username and password and will be able to post their adverts directly to the system. They will
have a to fill out a standard form with all the relevant information before submitting the advert.
The course coordinator will then review it to determine whether or not it is relevant for the
students. If so, the adverts is made available to the students.
