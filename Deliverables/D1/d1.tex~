% This is a template for constructing your project plan document, but
% also to show the use of the l3deliverable class. Use pdflatex and
% bibtex to process the file, creating a PDF file as output (there is
% no need to use dvips when using pdflatex).
%
% Several meta data commands have been implemented to collect
% information such as deliverable identifier, project name etc (see
% below the \date command.

\documentclass{l3deliverable}

% You can use the svn-multi package to automatically insert version
% control information into your document (an example of how to do this
% is shown below).  Make sure to set the 'svn:keywords' subversion
% property to 'Id' for the source file, for example, type:
%
% svn propset svn:keywords 'Id' d1.tex
%
% in the same directory as your 'd2.tex' file. 
%
% The information between the two $$ will now be updated when you next
% commit the file to your SVN repository.
%
% You can of course, just use this field to insert manual version
% information, e.g. 1.2, 1.2.1 ... instead.

\hline \textbf{Name} &\textbf{Roles}\\

\end{center}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Authority}

The Project Manager role was assigned to Ross Adam. Important group decisions will be democratically discussed within the group and the most popular ideas will be carried forward. The project manager will mediate any disagreements within the group and ensure that deadlines are met.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Communication}

Meetings will be held at least once a week on Mondays between 12 o'clock and 2 o'clock, likely within the University’s library or the Level 3 Computing
Lab. Any additional meeting arrangements will be discussed and finalised at the end of each meeting.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Information Management}

The librarian is repsonsible for maintaining the documents and information that pertain to the project.
We intend to use..\\

Mahara: \textit{Utilising a private forum as a central document and information index.}\\
GitHub: \textit{Online SCM hosting for our codebase and Latex documents.}\\
Facebook: \textit{Informal progress updates, idea sketching and general conversation.}\\


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Organisational Risks}

The role based model suggests less risks than with alternatives but if someone was to fall behind or
become absent then their role within the team would be compromised. If not immediately addressed
this could threaten the project’s integrity. To deal with this, the person is warned about his/her attendance and if it continues, it will be mentioned in the peer assessment and the course coordinator will be notified.
