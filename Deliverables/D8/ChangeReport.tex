\section{Introduction}

Team V's a change report describing our modiÔ¨Åcations to our internship management system.

\section{Report}

In order to include the new requirements in our internship management system, we had to make several changes to our implementation. The changes applied to our internship management system are:\\

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline \textbf{ID} &\textbf{Package/Class} & \textbf{Changes Applied}\\
\hline 1 & uk.ac.glasgow.internman.users.StudentUser & Return type for getInternship() \\
\hline 2 & uk.ac.glasgow.internman.impl.InternManStub & approveAcceptedOffer() parameters \\
\hline 3 & uk.ac.glasgow.internman.ui.ApproveOfferCommand & Changed parameters to reflect Change ID 2\\
\hline 4 & uk.ac.glasgow.internman.ui.ViewStudentDetailCommand & Changed to iterate over internship details \\
\hline 5 & uk.ac.glasgow.internman.ui.InternManStub & selectStudent()\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Change ID: 1}

In our previous implementation, a student could only accept one internship. However, according to the new requirements, a student must be able to accept more than one internship. In order to meet these requirements, we had to change the getInternship() method from an Object Internship to a List<Internship>. This allows the system to store a list of all internships that a student has accepted rather than a single internship per student. As we had changed this method in the java class, we then had to change the interface to reflect this change.\\

\subsection{Change ID: 2}

In our previous implementation, when the course coordinator was approving an accepted internship, he simply had to pass in the students matriculation number. However, as the student can now have multiple accepted internships, we had to change the parameters for the ApproveAcceptedOffer() method of the facade to pass in an Internship index, which specifies what internship the course coordinator was approving along with the student's matriculation number.

\subsection{Change ID: 3}

Previously, within the ApprovedOfferCommand, when calling the ApproveAcceptedOffer() method, it was simply passing in the students matriculation number. We modified this to pass in the students Internship ID, as well as the students matriculation number. 
Due to the changes in Change ID 2, a number of commands in uk.ac.glasgow.internman/ui/ApproveOfferCommand were malfunctioning. To solve this we had to apply some modifications to some methods of the class in order to get them to work with the changes that were made to the facade. Namely, we created an integer internshipID which is reading in args[1] 

String matriculation = args[0];
Integer internshipID = Integer.valueOf(args[1]);	
facade.approveAcceptedOffer(matriculation, internshipID);
Student student = facade.selectStudent(matriculation);
	if (student != null){
		Internship internship = student.getInternship().get(internshipID);
\subsection{Change ID: 4}
