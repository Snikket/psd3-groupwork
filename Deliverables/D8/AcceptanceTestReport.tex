\section{Test Assessment}
Upon completion of the testing plan and this document it is evident that testing could have been much more robust and detailed. Several tests deviated from the test plan mostly because a different user's details were supplied. This may be a minor factor but it could have influenced the results. Additionally several tests required minor modification to match up to the tests we implemented: most evidently was the use of test case T.C.5.10.1 with several different login detail variations.

\section{Test Results}
From the results it seems evident that the system was developed primarily from the perspective of the Course Co-ordinator. This makes sense from an implementation point of view because most of the functions specified are for use by the Course Co-ordinator. However, it appears to have adversely effected the development of both the Student and Employer users. Many errors stem from tests where employer or students are logged in.\\
As mentioned in the Test Assessment, section there were many deviations and modifications to existing the test. Only the log in details were changed for each to facilitate different user log in sessions. 

\section{Unit/Module/System Testing}
Unit testing activities were performed during the development of the system build.

\section{Variances}
To prepare the tests we had to create several artificial entries for use within the system to use for testing. Also several import statements were added to the code that Team U's implementation required.
In order for our tests to be run on Team U's implementation we had to alter our test stub to integrate with their code. Firstly we had to alter one of our method names to match the one they provided. getID() which was Team V's method of retrieving a student's unique matriculation number became getMatriculation() for the tests.  
Overall there was little deviation from the pre-approved test plan.

\section{Test Instances}
In each test instance where an error occurred it was the result of a Null Pointer Exception being thrown. This implied that where a comparison in the code was being performed there was no object to be compared against which resulted in the aforementioned exception. 

\subsection{Unresolved Test Instances}

Test Instances to be resolved:\\

\begin{enumerate} 
\item getCurrentUserTest() associated methods need refinement as the returned results do not match the expected input.
\item getAdvertisementsForStudentsTest() associated methods need refinement as the returned results do not match the expected input.
\item getAdvertisementsForStudentsTest() created error, requires major re-assessment and re-iteration.
\item registerNewEmployerTest() associated methods need refinement as the returned results do not match the expected input.
\item getCurrentEmployerTest() associated methods need refinement as the returned results do not match the expected input.
\item selectAdvertisementTest() associated methods need refinement as the returned results do not match the expected input.
\item selectRoleTest() created error, requires major re-assessment and re-iteration.
\item selectStudentTest() created error, requires major re-assessment and re-iteration.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Recommendations}
It is recommended that the development team return to and re-assess how Student and Employer objects are utilised within the system. Specifically the program's many get methods as they caused significant problems during testing. These methods should then be re-tested using identical test criteria.
