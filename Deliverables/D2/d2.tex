\section{Quality Assurance Plan}

The Quality Assurance plan will follow a set rigid structure for each deliverable.

\textbf{Inspection Process}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Breakdown Document in to smaller task sections
Initially documents will need to be broken down into sections. This has two distinct advantages: firstly it allows us to divide work up within the team and secondly it will identify key areas that may require greater attention.

\item Allocate sufficient time to complete task
If a section of work warrants a single task on our Task Schedule it will be allocated a length of time to be completed within. Providing deadlines will ensure a constant progression to deliverable completion.

\item Create an issue on GitHub
This acts as a formal notification that work has been allocated to a team member and tracks its progress. This also tracks overall progress to deliverable completion.

\item Close Issue on GitHub
Once a task has been completed the responsible team member marks it as complete. Once all tasks are complete the document is assembled.

\item Initial review
In this stage the document is examined as a group to confirm that all necessary information is included. If so, the document proceeds to stage 6 otherwise the missing work is reallocated and a new issue opened on GitHub. Any additions will be assigned to the person who was responsible for the section they were to be included in.

\item Final Review
This stage is used to ensure that the document compiles correctly and is free from both spelling and grammatical errors. It will be conducted by our Quality Assuror Asset.
\end{enumerate}

These stages will ensure that a document is of a suitable quality for release. However ultimately the decision to finalise and release a document is made by the person in charge of compilation after all members agree it is fit for release.\\

At all times throughout the document's lifespan the team member is responsible for their own spelling and will be using word processors and other spellchecking devices to ensure their work is of significant quality. Only as the deadline for release approaches will other members of the team proof read another's work.

\hline \textbf{Risk ID} &\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Probability} & \textbf{Impact} & \textbf{Controls}\\
\hline R1 & Requirements & Functional and non-functional requirements may be interpreted differently by team members due to the lack of interviews. & Meduim & High / The final product may behave differently and delays in fixing problems. & C1, C3, C5\\
\hline R2 & Requirements & Team members may ask inappropriate questions or miss important requirements. & Low & Medium / This may lead to improper documentation of the product. & C2, C8\\
\hline R3 & Requirements & The stakeholders are not sure how the final product should be. & High & Medium / Stakeholders may not be satisfied with product developed. & C1, C3, C5\\
\hline R4 & Skills & Team Members may overestimate their skills & Very high & Medium / The quality of the product will be lower than what was specified. & C1, C3, C5\\
\hline R5 & Requirements & Releasing poorly written documents to the client. & Medium & High / Consequently, the product may not reach expectations & C3, C5, C7\\
\hline R6 & Technical & Team members are unfamiliar with appropriate tools & Medium & High/ Consequently, the product may not reach expectations & C3, C7\\
\hline R7 & Requirements & Tasks may be left from the time-line & Medium & Medium/ This may lead to potential delays & C6\\
\hline R8 & Prototyping & Prototype is not compatible with client's specification & Medium & High/ Changing all specification and possibly start all the work again & C3, C7\\

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline \textbf{Control ID} & \textbf{Description}\\
\hline C1 &  Iteratively checking the specification of the product with stakeholders\\
\hline C2 & Prepare the questions with team for the interview\\
\hline C3 & Use other expert advise about the product development\\
\hline C4 & Make presentation of the software system to the stakeholders\\
\hline C5 & Develop the prototype of the product, based on bash script\\
\hline C6 & Check the work by two members of the team\\
\hline C7 & Investigate software competency and other skills within team\\
\hline C8 & Assign one member to conduct the interviews\\

\section{Configuration Management Plan}

To safely and successfully produce both the documentation and code
associated with our program there must be a stringent configuration
management plan.\\

\begin {enumerate}
\item \textbf{Change Management}\\
The decision to create a prototype rather than use incremental
development will allow us to let the client interact with a primitive,
yet functional system quickly.\\
The prototype will help elicit and validate system requirements while
also increasing our understanding of the system and uncover any
additional requirements that may have been omitted.\\

\item \textbf{Version Management}\\
In order to prevent a team member's work being overwritten
accidentally, Team V will be using GitHub to keep a central repository
of work. This can then be pulled from the GitHub site and worked on in
a local workspace. To prevent the aforementioned interference, local work is
merged back into the central repository safely.\\  

\item \textbf{System Building}\\
As above we will be using GitHub to maintain consistency in the
codeline.\\

\item \textbf{Release Management}\\
Team V will be utilising the issues feature on GitHub to highlight
completed tasks and milestones. It can also be used to assign new
tasks for memebers to complete. This will allow the team to track
current releases. \\
\end{enumerate}

Generally, if changes need to be made the team will have to discuss
several different points to conclude if it should be addressed:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Consequences of not implementing the change}\\
If a change is needed to alter a serious system failure it will be
prioritised and addressed quickly. However, if it is a simple error it
will be logged and corrected as current high priority tasks allow.

\item \textbf{Benefits of change}\\
Will the change benefit the majority of users or will it simply
benefit the change proposer? 

\item \textbf{Number of Users affected by change}\\
If the change is for the benefit of only a few users is it worth the
risk to potentially adversely effect more users? 

\item \textbf{Cost of making the change}\\
If the change is likely to create new bugs or take a long time to
implement it may simply be rejected.

\end{enumerate}

If these steps are followed then the software can be maintained
easily and changes can be handled efficiently.
