\subsection{Work Breakdown Structure}

Describe the logical structure for managing acquisition and
development (or relevant subsection thereof) by means of a Work
Breakdown Structure (WBS) scheme that is coordinated with the resource
allocation described in Subsection \ref{sec:allocation}. An
activities-oriented rather than an organisation- or product oriented
WBS is recommended. The level of detail given in the WBS should be
sufficient to support sound management practices.

For purposes of the WBS, identify the activities to be
undertaken. Define these in terms of a descriptive statement in
operational terms of activities and identification of the products to
be delivered or outcomes of the activity.

For each activity give: 

\begin{itemize}
\item an identifying label;
\item a descriptive statement in operational terms (what needs to be
  done);
\item identification of outcomes, including deliverables; and
\item a brief risk assessment.
\end{itemize}

For example, using the PSDTask environment (defined in this document's
header):

\begin{PSDTask}{1}{Breakdown of Initial Problem Definition}
  \PSDTaskDescription{ Discussing the initial problems and forming our own ideas of how to approach the client's task.}%
  \PSDTaskOutcomes{Problem breakdown.}%
  \PSDTaskDeliverables{None}%
  \PSDTaskRisks{Own interpretation of problem might be wrong.}
\end{PSDTask}

\begin{PSDTask}{2}{Prepare Interview Plan}
  \PSDTaskDescription{ Construct questions for Customer Liaison to ask the client in order to elicit requirements. Questions will then be approved by group. An interview plan will then be written consisting of these questions.
}%
  \PSDTaskOutcomes{Interview Plan document.}%
  \PSDTaskDeliverables{None}%
  \PSDTaskRisks{Questions may be in inappropriate may be too many or
    too few questions.}
\end{PSDTask}

\begin{PSDTask}{3}{Conduct Interview}
  \PSDTaskDescription{ Meeting with client to collect requirements using the Interview Plan document. If additional information is revealed plan document will be deviated from.}%
  \PSDTaskOutcomes{Client requirements collected}%
  \PSDTaskDeliverables{None}%
  \PSDTaskRisks{ Client might be unclear or provide incorrect specifications.}
\end{PSDTask}

\begin{PSDTask}{4}{Prepare Requirements Specification document}
  \PSDTaskDescription{ Meeting with client to collect requirements using the Interview Plan document. If additional information is revealed plan document will be deviated from.}%
  \PSDTaskOutcomes{Client requirements collected}%
  \PSDTaskDeliverables{D3}%
  \PSDTaskRisks{ Client might be unclear or provide incorrect specifications.}
\end{PSDTask}

\begin{PSDTask}{5}{Prepare Paper Prototype}
  \PSDTaskDescription{ Creating a paper prototype showing an outline of the different screens layout and navigation paths.}%
  \PSDTaskOutcomes{Paper Prototype Created}%
  \PSDTaskDeliverables{None}%
  \PSDTaskRisks{Prototype might be confusing to developers.}
\end{PSDTask}

\begin{PSDTask}{6}{Create Bash Prototype of the Application}
  \PSDTaskDescription{Creating the first actual prototype of the application written in Bash Scripting Language.}%
  \PSDTaskOutcomes{Bash Prototype created}%
  \PSDTaskDeliverables{D4}%
  \PSDTaskRisks{Developer might create an application which is not according the specifications.}
\end{PSDTask}

\begin{PSDTask}{7}{Demonstrate Bash Prototype to Customer.}
  \PSDTaskDescription{Giving the Customer a first view of how the application functions. The customer will have the opportunity to ask questions and the customer liaison will be available to give answers}%
  \PSDTaskOutcomes{Bash Prototype demonstrated to Customer}%
  \PSDTaskDeliverables{D4}%
  \PSDTaskRisks{******* TO DO *******.}
\end{PSDTask}

\end{table}

The purpose of this subsection is to list and describe the resources
available to support the activities defined in the WBS. The resources
may include team members involved in the activity, roles assigned and
estimated overall effort (in person days or other appropriate
measure).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Schedules}

Present the schedules on which performance and resource planning are
based. Include a task table, Gantt and PERT charts.

\section{Assurance Plan}

Describe the activities to be performed by for assurance of the
software and other deliverables.

Assurance activities include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Review and acceptance testing of products
\item Verification and validation procedures
\end{enumerate}

The contents of this subsection will be explained later in the 1st
semester in the PSD lectures. For initial hand-in deadline, you may
leave this subsection blank or make your best effort to produce an
assurance plan.
