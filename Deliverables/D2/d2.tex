\subsection{Work Breakdown Structure}

Describe the logical structure for managing acquisition and
development (or relevant subsection thereof) by means of a Work
Breakdown Structure (WBS) scheme that is coordinated with the resource
allocation described in Subsection \ref{sec:allocation}. An
activities-oriented rather than an organisation- or product oriented
WBS is recommended. The level of detail given in the WBS should be
sufficient to support sound management practices.

For purposes of the WBS, identify the activities to be
undertaken. Define these in terms of a descriptive statement in
operational terms of activities and identification of the products to
be delivered or outcomes of the activity.

For each activity give: 

\begin{itemize}
\item an identifying label;
\item a descriptive statement in operational terms (what needs to be
  done);
\item identification of outcomes, including deliverables; and
\item a brief risk assessment.
\end{itemize}

\section{Assurance Plan}


The Quality Assurance Plan(The QAP) is the basis for maintaining the quality of our product on the highest level that matches the requirements for the given software system and approved by stakeholders. The QAP will be overseen by the team to maintain quality improvement activities, such as monitoring, adding features and evaluating defects. The purpose of the QAP is designed to match the following requirements:\\

\begin{itemize}
\item to perform suitable actions when possibilities for improvements in service are identified.\\
\item to implement corrective action when technical issues or bugs are found.\\
\item to ensure that the software system is maintaining properly all the time.\\
\end{itemize}

Our team will mainly rely on Risk Management Plan, Product Requirements Specification and Change Management Plan to keep the product quality to the appropriate level.\\

Team activities:\\

Team members use the special group on Facebook to discuss their thoughts. All the documentation and code are  accessible on GitHub for all members as well as supervisors. It is the responsibility of everyone to ensure that update will not harm any working parts of the system. After altering any part of the code, we invoke test sets to check if the corresponding oracles match expected outputs.\\ 

Team should have one or more meetings every week to discuss the progress of the work. The tasks should be equally divided by team members and this is being added to the timeline of tasks. Every member is in charge of reviewing all finished tasks and task is approved by team if two or more member of the team approves it. \\

Product documentation(Deliverables) are ready to submit when members have no offers how to improve the document. Latex tool is used to produce the documentation.  Feedback for the deliverables is carefully analysed and corrections are done by the whole team at the end of term.\\

In order to make sure the quality of the product will be high and the team is in the right direction, team meets the supervisor every week as well as the clients few times per term.\\

Apart from that, we use black box testing with other teams to check if they can find bugs in prototype, as they have a fresh look to the product.\\

\section{Configuration Management Plan}




Describe the activities and plans for configuration management to be
performed by the organization preparing this Management Plan. The
primary topics for the plan include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Configuration management process
\item Configuration control activities
\item Configuration identification
\item Configuration change control
\end{enumerate}

The contents of this subsection will be explained later in the 1st
semester in the PSD lectures. For initial hand-in deadline, you may
leave this subsection blank or make your best effort to produce an
assurance plan.
